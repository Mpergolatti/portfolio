            <p> Welcome to my page! For 30 years i've been messing with electronics. From video games to building my own PC's. Video games are a HUGE passion of mine but ever since i've started coding I've found a new hobby that I can designate all my time too. I have a few project plans for myself to accomplish and hopefully publish in the future. I look forward to learning everything possible when It comes to coding.  </p>
            <br>
            <p> I was born in Connecticut but moved to Florida when I was very young and lived there for 30 years. I love the mountains and my Fiance and I have a goal to buy a 40ft pull behind and live in it around the country for a few years. She works from home and If I can ever snag a work from home job we are going to live our dream of working in a new location every 4-6 months! Life is way too short to not live it to the fullest!</p>
